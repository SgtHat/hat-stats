If you want to just read through the points play by play then you can just navigate through the folder in github but for a more indepth view and to be able to see graphs and tables, follow the below:<br /><br />

To use this notebook, firstly download and install Obsidian from https://obsidian.md/ an account is not required. <br />
Then download the contents of this repository and put it wherever you like on your PC.<br />
Open obsidian and click on "Open Folder as vault"<br />
Select the folder that you just downloaded and it should open the project up, it may ask you to trust the author, please do, it's only me.<br />
Then you will be able to navigate through the pages and see the stats. <br />
<br />
Let me know if you have any issues. Either raise an issue on the github repository, or Drop me a message.<br />
I can do a more in depth run through if needed.<br />
