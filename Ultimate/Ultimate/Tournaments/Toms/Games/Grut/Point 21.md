### Play By Play
Match D with Rollo in the deep space.

Lots of little tossy toss in the back field.
More communication needed on the switching at 1:13:45 - [[Turner]] and [[Penny]] both fielding the same guy up the line leaving and easy swing further back.

Excecution error on a free catch. not marking as a D.

1. [[Penny]]picks up left side at about halfway.
2. Fouled on a throw down the line. Plays for time on the continuation like a seasoned vet.
3. Inside break to [[Big Seb]] up the line.
4. little open side shot to [[Rhod]] in the middle brick.
5. endzone corner shot to [[Pepe]] for the score
